### Hey There!

Welcome to my personal site! I am a data analyst working in e-commerce business. I specialize in using R and Tableau for data analysis, product-cowork, and data visualizations. I am also passionate about Quantify-me, knowledge sharing / dissemination, and how to mix the two. Check out my most recent projects on my Portfolio tab.

**Let's collaborate!**\
